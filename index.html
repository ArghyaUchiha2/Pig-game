          ðŸ“’ Rules:
        </h3>
        <p>
          <br>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":<br>

1. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.<br>
3. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.<br>

The first player to score 50 or more points wins.<br>
For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score.
